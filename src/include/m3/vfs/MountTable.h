/**
 * Contains a list of mount points and offers operations to manage them.

 * The mount table itself does not create or delete mount points. Instead, it only works with
 * pointers. The creation and deletion is done in VFS. The rational is, that VFS is used to
 * manipulate the mounts of the own activity, while MountTable is used to manipulate the mounts of
 * created activities. Thus, one can simply add a mointpoint from Activity::self() to a different activity by
 * passing a pointer around. If the mount table of a child activity is completely setup, it is serialized
 * and transferred to the child activity.
