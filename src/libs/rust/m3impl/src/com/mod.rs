//! Contains communication abstractions
//!
//! Communication on MÂ³ is performed via the trusted communication unit (TCU) and comes in two
//! primary flavors: message passing and DMA-like memory access. The communication abstractions can
//! be devided in two layers: lower-level primitives that work with the TCU and higher-level
//! primitives and build on top of them.
//!
//! # Endpoints and gates
//!
//! The lower-level primitives are [`endpoints`](`EP`) and [`gates`](`gate::Gate`). Each TCU-based
//! communication channel is represented by *endpoints* (EPs) in the TCU. A message-passing channel
//! consists of a send EP and a receive EP, whereas a memory-channel consists of a single memory EP.
//! A *gate* is the software abstraction that comes in three variants, corresponding to the endpoint
//! types: [`SendGate`], [`RecvGate`], and [`MemGate`]. All gates therefore use a specific endpoint
//! for the communication and need to be *activated* before they can be used. The activation of a
//! gate allocates an endpoint (if required) and configures the endpoint for the gate.
//!
//! # Streams and channels
//!
//! The higher-level primitives are streams and channels. [`GateOStream`] allows to marshall data
//! types into a message, whereas [`GateIStream`] allows to unmarshall a message into data types.
//! Both work in combination with [`SendGate`]s and [`RecvGate`]s, respectively. A
//! [`channel`](`chan::sync_channel`) provides a synchronous uni-directional communication channel
//! based on gates.
