/// A receive gate receives messages via TCU
///
/// A [`RecvGate`] works in combination with [`SendGate`]s to form message passing channels. Such a
/// channel exists between a [`SendGate`] and [`RecvGate`] and allows to exchange messages, always
/// initiated by the [`SendGate`]. Upon receiving a message, the [`RecvGate`] can send a reply to
/// the message, though.
///
/// # Message passing basics
///
/// A [`SendGate`] is always connected to exactly one [`RecvGate`], whereas a [`RecvGate`] can
/// receive messages from multiple [`SendGate`]s. Each message consists of a header, provided by the
/// TCU, and a payload, provided by the sender. Thus, headers are trustworthy (we always trust the
/// TCU), whereas the payloads are not. The header contains meta data about the message such as its
/// length and a *label*. A label can be set for each [`SendGate`], which allows to distinguish
/// between senders. On the receiver side, messages are stored in a *receive buffer*. Hence, each
/// [`RecvGate`] has an associated receive buffer, represented by [`RecvBuf`].
///
/// # Receive buffer and credit system
///
/// The receive buffer is split into fixed-sized slots and shared among all senders, but each sender
/// has a certain number of *credits* that limits the available space for that sender. Messages can
/// be smaller than the slot size (to reduce traffic), but not larger. The credit system is
/// implemented by the TCU and requires senders to have at least one credit when sending a message.
/// If one credit is available, the number of credits is reduced by one. The number of credits is
/// increased again upon a reply from the receiver. If at most as many credits as receive-buffer
/// slots are handed out to senders, each sender has the guarantee that message sending will always
/// succeed. Otherwise, senders receive the [`RecvNoSpace`](`Code::RecvNoSpace`) error in case all
/// slots are occupied.
///
/// # Receive buffer slots
///
/// To keep track of the receive buffer slots, slots can be in three states: `free`, `unread`, and
/// `occupied`. Free slots are filled by the TCU upon message reception, which brings the slot into
/// the `unread` state. Thus, unread slots contain new messages (not seen by the software). These
/// messages can be *fetched* from the receive buffer via [`RecvGate::fetch`], which brings the slot
/// into the `occupied` state. As soon as the message has been processed, the software should inform
/// the TCU about that by *acknowledging* the message via [`RecvGate::ack_msg`], which brings the
/// slot back into the `free` state.
///
/// # Message reception and processing
///
/// The TCU stores received messages into the next slot that is `free` by walking over the slots in
/// round-robin fashion and remembering the last used slot (to prevent starvation). New messages are
/// retrieved via [`RecvGate::fetch`] in non-blocking fashion or [`RecvGate::receive`] in blocking
/// fashion. Note also that this allows to reply to messages out of order. That is, it is possible
/// to receive message A first and then message B, but first reply to message B and later to message
/// A.
///
/// Messages are implicitly acknowledged when replying to the message (see [`RecvGate::reply`]), but
/// need to be acknowledged explicitly otherwise (see [`RecvGate::ack_msg`]).
///
/// # Activation
///
/// Activation is the process of turning a receive capability into a usable receive gate for
/// receiving messages via TCU. Thus, activation allocates and configures a TCU endpoint. A
/// `RecvGate` is always activated from the start, whereas `RecvCap` is only the capability that can
/// be turned into a `RecvGate` by activating it. If you want to receive messages yourself, you can
/// simply create a new `RecvGate`. However, if you want someone else to receive messages, you
/// should create a `RecvCap` and delegate it to the desired activity, which can then turn it into a
/// `RecvGate`.
