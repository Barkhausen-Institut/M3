/// Represents a certain amount of kernel memory

/// Kernel memory is used by the MÂ³ kernel to fulfill operations on behalf of activities. For
/// example, if the [`create_sgate`](`syscalls::create_sgate`) system call is used to create a new
/// [`SendGate`](`crate::com::SendGate`), the kernel needs memory to create the associated kernel
/// object. To prevent DOS attacks on the kernel, the kernel requires that this amount of memory is
/// available in the calling activity's kernel memory quota. This kernel memory quota is represented
/// by [`KMem`].
///
/// As the amount of kernel memory is fixed at boot, [`KMem`] instances cannot be created, but all
/// available memory is passed to the root activity, which distributes it among its children
/// accordingly. For that reason, [`KMem`] supports the [`derive`](`KMem::derive`) operation that
/// splits off a certain amount of kernel memory into a new [`KMem`] object.
