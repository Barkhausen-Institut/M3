//! The virtual file system (VFS)
//!
//! The VFS provides access to file systems and files. All file systems implement the [`FileSystem`]
//! trait, whereas files implement the [`File`] trait. The former is currently only implemented by
//! [`M3FS`](`crate::client::M3FS`) as this is the only available file system on MÂ³. The latter is
//! implemented by multiple types:
//! - files that implement the *file protocol*: [`GenericFile`]
//! - sockets: [`UdpSocket`](`crate::net::UdpSocket`), [`TcpSocket`](`crate::net::TcpSocket`), and
//!   [`RawSocket`](`crate::net::RawSocket`)
//! - file references: [`FileRef`]
//!
//! # Accessing files and directories
//!
//! [`VFS`] offers the application-facing API to open files, create directories, rename files, etc.
//! For example, a file can be opened and read in the following way:
//!
//! ```
//! let mut file = VFS::open("/dir/myfile", OpenFlags::R).unwrap();
//! let content = file.read_to_string().unwrap();
//! println!("content: {}", content);
//! ```
//!
//! Similarly, a directory can be listed as follows:
//! ```
//! for entry in VFS::read_dir("/mydir").unwrap() {
//!   println!("Found entry {}", entry.file_name());
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! # File references
//!
//! When opening a file or directory, applications do not work directly with an implementation of
//! [`File`], but indirectly via [`FileRef`]. As the name implies, [`FileRef`] holds a reference to
//! the file (file descriptor) and provides access to all methods from [`File`] by implementing the
//! trait itself. Most importantly, [`FileRef`] closes the file automatically on drop.
//!
//! # FileTable and MountTable
//!
//! [`FileTable`] and [`MountTable`] hold all open files and mount points, respectively. Files are
//! found via an index into the table called *file descriptor*, whereas mount points are found by
//! file path. Therefore, opening a file via [`VFS::open`] expects a file path that is first
//! resolved via [`MountTable`] to the file system at the corresponding mount path and the remaining
//! path within the file system. [`VFS::open`] then refers to the found [`FileSystem`]
//! implementation to open the file on the server side. Finally, a [`File`] instance is created and
//! inserted into the [`FileTable`]. The caller of [`VFS::open`] receives a [`FileRef`] that holds
//! the file descriptor and provides access to the methods of [`File`] by borrowing the [`File`]
//! object from [`FileTable`] during the call.
//!
//! # Delegation of files and mount points
//!
//! [`FileTable`] and [`MountTable`] are not used directly, but indirectly through
//! [`OwnActivity`](`crate::tiles::OwnActivity`), which in turn is used by [`FileRef`] to get to the
//! file it references. The reason is that both files and file systems can be delegated to
//! [`ChildActivity`](`crate::tiles::ChildActivity`)s. Therefore,
//! [`ChildActivity`](`crate::tiles::ChildActivity`) keeps a list of files and mount points to
//! delegate and uses [`FileTable`] and [`MountTable`] before starting the activity to perform the
//! delegation. [`OwnActivity`](`crate::tiles::OwnActivity`) uses [`FileTable`] and [`MountTable`]
//! to receive these delegations upon application start and provides access to them afterwards.
