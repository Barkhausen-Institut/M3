WC(1)                              BSD General Commands Manual                              WC(1)

NAME
     wc -- word, line, and byte or character count

SYNOPSIS
     wc [-c | -m] [-hlw] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
     The wc utility reads one or more input text files and, by default, writes the number of
     lines, words, and bytes contained in each input file to the standard output.  If more than
     one input file is specified, a line of cumulative count(s) for all named files is output on
     a separate line following the last file count.  wc considers a word to be a maximal string
     of characters delimited by whitespace.  Whitespace characters are the set of characters for
     which the isspace(3) function returns true.

     The options are as follows:

     -c      The number of bytes in each input file is written to the standard output.

     -h      Use unit suffixes: Byte, Kilobyte, Megabyte, Gigabyte, Terabyte, Petabyte, and Ex-
             abyte in order to reduce the number of digits to four or fewer using powers of 2 for
             sizes (K=1024, M=1048576, etc.).

     -l      The number of lines in each input file is written to the standard output.

     -m      Count characters instead of bytes, and use iswspace(3) instead of isspace(3).

     -w      The number of words in each input file is written to the standard output.

     When an option is specified, wc only reports the information requested by that option.  The
     default action is equivalent to the flags -clw having been specified.

     If no file names are specified, the standard input is used and a file name is not output.
     The resulting output is one line of the requested count(s) with the cumulative sum of all
     files read in via standard input.

     By default, the standard output contains a line for each input file of the form:

           lines    words  bytes   file_name

     The counts for lines, words, and bytes (or characters) are integers separated by spaces.

ENVIRONMENT
     LC_CTYPE  The character encoding locale(1).  It decides which byte sequences form charac-
               ters.  If unset or set to "C", "POSIX", or an unsupported value, -m has the same
               effect as -c.

EXIT STATUS
     The wc utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

SEE ALSO
     isspace(3)

STANDARDS
     The wc utility is compliant with the IEEE Std 1003.1-2008 ("POSIX.1") specification.

     The flag [-h] is an extension to that specification.

HISTORY
     A wc utility appeared in Version 1 AT&T UNIX.
