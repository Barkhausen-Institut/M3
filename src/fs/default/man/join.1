JOIN(1)                            BSD General Commands Manual                            JOIN(1)

NAME
     join -- relational database operator

SYNOPSIS
     join [-1 field] [-2 field] [-a file_number | -v file_number] [-e string] [-o list] [-t char]
          file1 file2

DESCRIPTION
     The join utility performs an "equality join" on the specified files and writes the result to
     the standard output.  The "join field" is the field in each file by which the files are com-
     pared.  The first field in each line is used by default.  There is one line in the output
     for each pair of lines in file1 and file2 which have identical join fields.  Each output
     line consists of the join field, the remaining fields from file1 and then the remaining
     fields from file2.

     The default field separators are tab and space characters.  In this case, multiple tabs and
     spaces count as a single field separator, and leading tabs and spaces are ignored.  The de-
     fault output field separator is a single space character.

     Many of the options use file and field numbers.  Both file numbers and field numbers are 1
     based, i.e., the first file on the command line is file number 1 and the first field is
     field number 1.

     When the default field delimiter characters are used, the files to be joined should be or-
     dered in the collating sequence of sort(1), using the -b option, on the fields on which they
     are to be joined, otherwise join may not report all field matches.  When the field delimiter
     characters are specified by the -t option, the collating sequence should be the same as
     sort(1) without the -b option.

     If one of the arguments file1 or file2 is `-', the standard input is used.

     The options are as follows:

     -1 field
             Join on the field'th field of file1.

     -2 field
             Join on the field'th field of file2.

     -a file_number
             In addition to the default output, produce a line for each unpairable line in file
             file_number.

     -e string
             Replace empty output fields with string.

     -o list
             Specifies the fields that will be output from each file for each line with matching
             join fields.  Each element of list has the form "file_number.field", where
             file_number is a file number and field is a field number, or the form "0" (zero),
             representing the join field.  The elements of list must be either comma (`,') or
             whitespace separated.  (The latter requires quoting to protect it from the shell, or
             a simpler approach is to use multiple -o options.)

     -t char
             Use character char as a field delimiter for both input and output.  Every occurrence
             of char in a line is significant.

     -v file_number
             Do not display the default output, but display a line for each unpairable line in
             file file_number.  The options -v 1 and -v 2 may be specified at the same time.

EXIT STATUS
     The join utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

STANDARDS
     The join utility is compliant with the IEEE Std 1003.1-2008 ("POSIX.1") specification.

     In the absence of the -o option, historical versions of join wrote non-matching lines with-
     out reordering the fields.  The current version writes the join field first, followed by the
     remaining fields.

     For compatibility with historical versions of join, the following options are available:

     -a          In addition to the default output, produce a line for each unpairable line in
                 both file1 and file2.

     -j field    Join on the field'th field of both file1 and file2.

     -j1 field   Join on the field'th field of file1.

     -j2 field   Join on the field'th field of file2.

     -o list ...
                 Historical implementations of join permitted multiple arguments to the -o op-
                 tion.  These arguments were of the form "file_number.field_number" as described
                 for the current -o option.  This has obvious difficulties in the presence of
                 files named "1.2".

     These options are available only so historical shell scripts don't require modification and
     should not be used.

HISTORY
     A join utility appeared in Version 7 AT&T UNIX.
