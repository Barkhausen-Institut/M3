MKDIR(1)                           BSD General Commands Manual                           MKDIR(1)

NAME
     mkdir -- make directories

SYNOPSIS
     mkdir [-p] [-m mode] directory ...

DESCRIPTION
     The mkdir utility creates the directories named as operands, in the order specified, using
     mode rwxrwxrwx (0777) as modified by the current umask(2).

     The options are as follows:

     -m mode
             Set the file permission bits of the newly created directory to mode.  The mode argu-
             ment can be in any of the formats specified to the chmod(1) utility.  If a symbolic
             mode is specified, the operators `+' and `-' are interpreted relative to an initial
             mode of "a=rwx".

     -p      Create intermediate directories as required.  If this option is not specified, the
             full path prefix of each operand must already exist.  Intermediate directories are
             created with permission bits of rwxrwxrwx (0777) as modified by the current umask,
             plus write and search permission for the owner.  Do not consider it an error if the
             argument directory already exists.

     The user must have write permission in the parent directory.  For an explanation of the di-
     rectory hierarchy, see hier(7).

EXIT STATUS
     The mkdir utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

EXAMPLES
     Create a directory named foobar:

           $ mkdir foobar

     Create a directory named foobar and set its file mode to 700:

           $ mkdir -m 700 foobar

     Create a directory named cow/horse/monkey, creating any non-existent intermediate directo-
     ries as necessary:

           $ mkdir -p cow/horse/monkey
