CUT(1)                             BSD General Commands Manual                             CUT(1)

NAME
     cut -- select portions of each line of a file

SYNOPSIS
     cut -b list [-n] [file ...]
     cut -c list [file ...]
     cut -f list [-s] [-d delim] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
     The cut utility selects portions of each line (as specified by list) from each file and
     writes them to the standard output.  If no file arguments are specified, or a file argument
     is a single dash (`-'), cut reads from the standard input.  The items specified by list can
     be in terms of column position or in terms of fields delimited by a special character.  Col-
     umn and field numbering starts from 1; output is in the same order as input, not in the or-
     der selected.

     list is a comma or whitespace separated set of numbers and/or number ranges.  Number ranges
     consist of a number, a dash (`-'), and a second number which select the fields or columns
     from the first number to the second, inclusive.  Numbers or number ranges may be preceded by
     a dash, which selects all fields or columns from 1 to the first number.  Numbers or number
     ranges may be followed by a dash, which selects all fields or columns from the last number
     to the end of the line.  Numbers and number ranges may be repeated, overlapping, and in any
     order.  It is not an error to select fields or columns not present in the input line.

     The options are as follows:

     -b list
             The list specifies byte positions.

     -c list
             The list specifies character positions.

     -d delim
             Use the first character of delim as the field delimiter character.  The default is
             the <TAB> character.

     -f list
             The list specifies fields, separated by the field delimiter character.  The selected
             fields are output, separated by the field delimiter character.

     -n      Do not split multi-byte characters.  A character is written to standard output if
             and only if the byte position holding its last byte is selected.

     -s      Suppresses lines with no field delimiter characters.  Unless specified, lines with
             no delimiters are passed through unmodified.

ENVIRONMENT
     LC_CTYPE  The character encoding locale(1).  It decides which byte sequences form charac-
               ters.  If unset or set to "C", "POSIX", or an unsupported value, -c does the same
               as -b, -n has no effect, and -d uses the first byte of delim.

EXIT STATUS
     The cut utility exits 0 if all input files are output successfully, and >0 if an error oc-
     curs.

EXAMPLES
     Extract login names and shells from the system passwd(5) file as "name:shell" pairs:

           $ cut -d : -f 1,7 /etc/passwd

     Show the names and login times of logged in users:

           $ who | cut -c 1-8,18-30

SEE ALSO
     awk(1), paste(1)

STANDARDS
     The cut utility is compliant with the IEEE Std 1003.1-2008 ("POSIX.1") specification.
