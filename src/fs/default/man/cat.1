CAT(1)                             BSD General Commands Manual                             CAT(1)

NAME
     cat -- concatenate and print files

SYNOPSIS
     cat [-benstuv] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
     The cat utility reads files sequentially, writing them to the standard output.  The file op-
     erands are processed in command-line order.  If file is a single dash (`-') or absent, cat
     reads from the standard input.

     The options are as follows:

     -b      Number the lines, but don't count blank lines.

     -e      Print a dollar sign (`$') at the end of each line.  Implies the -v option to display
             non-printing characters.

     -n      Number the output lines, starting at 1.

     -s      Squeeze multiple adjacent empty lines, causing the output to be single spaced.

     -t      Print tab characters as `^I'.  Implies the -v option to display non-printing charac-
             ters.

     -u      The output is guaranteed to be unbuffered (see setvbuf(3)).

     -v      Displays non-printing characters so they are visible.  Control characters print as
             `^X' for control-X, with the exception of the tab and EOL characters, which are dis-
             played normally.  The DEL character (octal 0177) prints as `^?'.  Non-ASCII charac-
             ters (with the high bit set) are printed as `M-' (for meta) followed by the charac-
             ter for the low 7 bits.

EXIT STATUS
     The cat utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

EXAMPLES
     Print the contents of file1 to the standard output:

           $ cat file1

     Sequentially print the contents of file1 and file2 to the file file3, truncating file3 if it
     already exists.  See the manual page for your shell (e.g., sh(1)) for more information on
     redirection.

           $ cat file1 file2 > file3

     Print the contents of file1, print data it receives from the standard input until it re-
     ceives an EOF (`^D') character, print the contents of file2, read and output contents of the
     standard input again, then finally output the contents of file3.  Note that if the standard
     input referred to a file, the second dash on the command line would have no effect, since
     the entire contents of the file would have already been read and printed by cat when it en-
     countered the first `-' operand.

           $ cat file1 - file2 - file3

STANDARDS
     The cat utility is compliant with the IEEE Std 1003.1-2008 ("POSIX.1") specification.

     The flags [-benstv] are extensions to that specification.

HISTORY
     A cat utility appeared in Version 1 AT&T UNIX.

CAVEATS
     Because of the shell language mechanism used to perform output redirection, the following
     command will cause the original data in file1 to be destroyed:

           $ cat file1 file2 > file1

     To append file2 to file1, instead use:

           $ cat file2 >> file1
