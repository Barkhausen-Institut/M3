NAME
     ls -- list directory contents

SYNOPSIS
     ls [-1AaCcdFfgHhikLlmnpqRrSsTtux] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
     For each operand that names a file of a type other than directory, ls displays its name as
     well as any requested, associated information.  For each named directory, ls displays the
     names of files contained within that directory, as well as any requested, associated infor-
     mation.

     If no operands are given, the contents of the current directory are displayed.  If more than
     one operand is given, non-directory operands are displayed first; directory and non-direc-
     tory operands are sorted separately and in lexicographical order.  By default, ls lists one
     entry per line to standard output; the exceptions are to terminals or when the -C, -m, or -x
     options are specified.

     The options are as follows:

     -1      (The numeric digit "one".)  Force output to be one entry per line.  This is the de-
             fault when output is not to a terminal.

     -A      List all entries except for `.' and `..'.  Always set for the superuser.

     -a      Include directory entries whose names begin with a dot (`.').

     -C      Force multi-column output; this is the default when output is to a terminal.

     -c      Use time file's status was last changed instead of last modification time for sort-
             ing (-t) or printing (-g, -l, or -n).

     -d      Directories are listed as plain files (not searched recursively) and symbolic links
             in the argument list are not indirected through.

     -F      Display a slash (`/') immediately after each pathname that is a directory, an aster-
             isk (`*') after each that is executable, an at sign (`@') after each symbolic link,
             an equal sign (`=') after each socket, and a vertical bar (`|') after each that is a
             FIFO.

     -f      Output is not sorted.  This option implies -a.

     -g      List in long format as in -l, except that the owner is not printed.

     -H      Follow symbolic links specified on the command line.  This is the default behaviour
             when none of the -d, -F, or -l options are specified.

     -h      When used with a long format option, use unit suffixes: Byte, Kilobyte, Megabyte,
             Gigabyte, Terabyte, Petabyte, and Exabyte in order to reduce the number of digits to
             four or fewer using powers of 2 for sizes (K=1024, M=1048576, etc.).

     -i      For each file, print its inode number.

     -k      Modifies the -s option, causing the sizes to be reported in kilobytes.  Overrides
             any value specified by the BLOCKSIZE environment variable.

     -L      If argument is a symbolic link, evaluate the file information and file type to be
             those of the file referenced by the link, and not the link itself; however, ls
             writes the name of the link itself and not the file referenced by the link.

     -l      (The lowercase letter "ell".)  List in long format (see below).  A total sum of all
             file sizes is output on a line before the long listing.  Output is one entry per
             line.

     -m      Stream output format; list files across the page, separated by commas.

     -n      List in long format as in -l, but retain user and group IDs in a numeric format.
             The output of -gn and -ng is identical: a long listing with numerical group ID, and
             no numerical user ID.  The output of -ln and -nl is identical: a long listing with
             numerical group and user ID.

     -p      Display a slash (`/') immediately after each pathname that is a directory.

     -q      Force printing of non-graphic characters in file names as the character `?'; this is
             the default when output is to a terminal.

     -R      Recursively list subdirectories encountered.

     -r      Reverse the order of the sort to get reverse lexicographical order or the smallest
             or oldest entries first.

     -S      Sort by size, largest file first.

     -s      Display the number of file system blocks actually used by each file, where partial
             units are rounded up to the next integer value.  Blocks are 512 bytes unless over-
             ridden by the -k flag or BLOCKSIZE environment variable.

     -T      Display complete time information for the file, including month, day, hour, minute,
             second, and year.  This option has no effect unless one of the long format (-g, -l,
             or -n) options is also specified.

     -t      Sort by time modified (most recently modified first) before sorting the operands in
             lexicographical order.

     -u      Use file's last access time instead of last modification time for sorting (-t) or
             printing (-g, -l, or -n).

     -x      Multi-column output sorted across the page rather than down the page.

     It is not an error to specify more than one of the following mutually exclusive options: -1,
     -C, -g, -l, -m, -n, and -x; and -c, -f, -S, -t, and -u.  Where more than one option is spec-
     ified from the same mutually exclusive group, the last option given overrides the others,
     except that -l always overrides -g; and -f always overrides -c, -S, -t, and -u.

   The Long Format
     If the -g, -l, or -n options are given, the following information is displayed for each
     file: mode, number of links, owner (though not for -g), group, size in bytes, time of last
     modification ("mmm dd HH:MM"), and the pathname.  In addition, for each directory whose con-
     tents are displayed, the first line displayed is the total number of blocks used by the
     files in the directory.  Blocks are 512 bytes unless overridden by the -k option or
     BLOCKSIZE environment variable.

     If the owner or group name is not a known user or group name, respectively, or the -n option
     is given, the numeric ID is displayed.

     If the file is a character special or block special file, the major and minor device numbers
     for the file are displayed in the size field.

     If the -T option is given, the time of last modification is displayed using the format "mmm
     dd HH:MM:SS ccyy".

     If the file is a symbolic link, the pathname of the linked-to file is preceded by "->".

     The file mode printed under the -g, -l, or -n options consists of the entry type, owner per-
     missions, group permissions, and other permissions.  The entry type character describes the
     type of file, as follows:

           -     regular file
           b     block special file
           c     character special file
           d     directory
           l     symbolic link
           p     FIFO
           s     socket link

     The next three fields are three characters each: owner permissions, group permissions, and
     other permissions.  Each field has three character positions:

           1.   If r, the file is readable; if -, it is not readable.
           2.   If w, the file is writable; if -, it is not writable.
           3.   The first of the following that applies:

                      S     If in the owner permissions, the file is not executable and set-user-
                            ID mode is set.  If in the group permissions, the file is not exe-
                            cutable and set-group-ID mode is set.

                      s     If in the owner permissions, the file is executable and set-user-ID
                            mode is set.  If in the group permissions, the file is executable and
                            set-group-ID mode is set.

                      x     The file is executable or the directory is searchable.

                      -     The file is neither readable, writable, executable, nor set-user-ID,
                            nor set-group-ID, nor sticky (see below).

                These next two apply only to the third character in the last group (other permis-
                sions):

                      T     The sticky bit is set (mode 1000), but neither executable nor search-
                            able (see chmod(1) or sticky(8)).

                      t     The sticky bit is set (mode 1000), and is searchable or executable
                            (see chmod(1) or sticky(8)).

     In addition, if the -o option is specified, the file flags (see chflags(1)) are displayed as
     comma-separated strings in front of the file size, abbreviated as follows:

           -         no flags
           arch      archived
           nodump    do not dump
           sappnd    system append-only
           schg      system immutable
           uappnd    user append-only
           uchg      user immutable

ENVIRONMENT
     BLOCKSIZE  If the environment variable BLOCKSIZE is set, and the -k option is not specified,
                the block counts (see -s) will be displayed in units of that size block.

     COLUMNS    If set to a positive integer, output is formatted to the given width in columns.
                Otherwise, ls defaults to the terminal width, or 80 columns if the output is not
                a terminal.

     LC_CTYPE   The character encoding locale(1).  It decides which byte sequences form charac-
                ters and what their display width is.  If unset or set to "C", "POSIX", or an un-
                supported value, non-ASCII bytes are replaced by question marks.

     TZ         The time zone to use when displaying dates.  See environ(7) for more information.

EXIT STATUS
     The ls utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

EXAMPLES
     List the contents of the current working directory in long format:

           $ ls -l

     In addition to listing the contents of the current working directory in long format, show
     inode numbers, file flags (see chflags(1)), and suffix each filename with a symbol repre-
     senting its file type:

           $ ls -lioF

     List the files in /var/log, sorting the output such that the most recently modified entries
     are printed first:

           $ ls -lt /var/log

STANDARDS
     The ls utility is compliant with the IEEE Std 1003.1-2008 ("POSIX.1") specification, except
     behaviour for the -o flag differs.

     The flags [-hT], as well as the BLOCKSIZE environment variable, are extensions to that spec-
     ification.

     The flags [-go] are marked by IEEE Std 1003.1-2008 ("POSIX.1") as being an X/Open System In-
     terfaces option.

     Historically, the -g flag was used to specify that the group field be included in long list-
     ings.  The group field is now automatically included in the long listing for files and the
     meaning of the -g flag has been changed in order to be compatible with the IEEE Std
     1003.1-2008 ("POSIX.1") specification.
