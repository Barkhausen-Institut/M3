RMDIR(1)                           BSD General Commands Manual                           RMDIR(1)

NAME
     rmdir -- remove directories

SYNOPSIS
     rmdir [-p] directory ...

DESCRIPTION
     The rmdir utility removes the directory entry specified by each directory argument, provided
     it is empty.

     Arguments are processed in the order given.  In order to remove both a parent directory and
     a subdirectory of that parent, the subdirectory must be specified first so the parent direc-
     tory is empty when rmdir tries to remove it.

     The options are as follows:

     -p      Each directory argument is treated as a pathname of which all components will be re-
             moved, if they are empty, starting with the last most component.  (See rm(1) for
             fully non-discriminant recursive removal.)

EXIT STATUS
     The rmdir utility exits with one of the following values:

           0       Each directory argument referred to an empty directory and was removed suc-
                   cessfully.
           >0      An error occurred.

EXAMPLES
     Remove the directory foobar, if it is empty:

           $ rmdir foobar

     Remove all directories up to and including cow, stopping at the first non-empty directory
     (if any):

           $ rmdir -p cow/horse/monkey
