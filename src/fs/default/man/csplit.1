CSPLIT(1)                          BSD General Commands Manual                          CSPLIT(1)

NAME
     csplit -- split files based on context

SYNOPSIS
     csplit [-ks] [-f prefix] [-n number] file args ...

DESCRIPTION
     The csplit utility splits file into pieces using the patterns args.  If file is a dash
     (`-'), csplit reads from standard input.

     Files are created with a prefix of "xx" and two decimal digits.  The size of each file is
     written to standard output as it is created.  If an error occurs whilst files are being cre-
     ated, or a HUP, INT, or TERM signal is received, all files previously written are removed.

     The options are as follows:

     -f prefix
             Create file names beginning with prefix, instead of "xx".

     -k      Do not remove previously created files if an error occurs or a HUP, INT, or TERM
             signal is received.

     -n number
             Create file names beginning with number of decimal digits after the prefix, instead
             of 2.

     -s      Do not write the size of each output file to standard output as it is created.

     The args operands may be a combination of the following patterns:

     /regexp/[[+|-]offset]
             Create a file containing the input from the current line to (but not including) the
             next line matching the given basic regular expression.  An optional offset from the
             line that matched may be specified.

     %regexp%[[+|-]offset]
             Same as above but a file is not created for the output.

     line_no
             Create containing the input from the current line to (but not including) the speci-
             fied line number.

     {num}   Repeat the previous pattern the specified number of times.  If it follows a line
             number pattern, a new file will be created for each line_no lines, num times.  The
             first line of the file is line number 1 for historic reasons.

     After all the patterns have been processed, the remaining input data (if there is any) will
     be written to a new file.

     Requesting to split at a line before the current line number or past the end of the file
     will result in an error.

EXIT STATUS
     The csplit utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

EXAMPLES
     Split the mdoc(7) file foo.1 into one file for each section (up to 21 files):

           $ csplit -k foo.1 '%^\.Sh%' '/^\.Sh/' '{20}'

     Split standard input after the first 99 lines and every 100 lines thereafter (up to 21
     files):

           $ csplit -k - 100 '{19}'

SEE ALSO
     sed(1), split(1), re_format(7)

STANDARDS
     The csplit utility is compliant with the IEEE Std 1003.1-2008 ("POSIX.1") specification.

HISTORY
     A csplit command appeared in PWB UNIX.

BUGS
     Input lines are limited to LINE_MAX (2048) bytes in length.
