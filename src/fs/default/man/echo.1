ECHO(1)                            BSD General Commands Manual                            ECHO(1)

NAME
     echo -- write arguments to the standard output

SYNOPSIS
     echo [-n] [string ...]

DESCRIPTION
     The echo utility writes any specified operands, separated by single blank (` ') characters
     and followed by a newline (`\n') character, to the standard output.

     When no operands are given, only the newline is written.  The -- operand, which generally
     denotes an end to option processing, is treated as part of string.

     The options are as follows:

     -n      Do not print the trailing newline character.

EXIT STATUS
     The echo utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

SEE ALSO
     csh(1), ksh(1), printf(1)

STANDARDS
     The echo utility is compliant with the IEEE Std 1003.1-2008 ("POSIX.1") specification.

     The flag [-n] conflicts with the behaviour mandated by the X/Open System Interfaces option
     of the IEEE Std 1003.1-2008 ("POSIX.1") specification, which says it should be treated as
     part of string.  Additionally, echo does not support any of the backslash character se-
     quences mandated by XSI.

     echo also exists as a built-in to csh(1) and ksh(1), though with a different syntax.

     Where portability is paramount, use printf(1).

HISTORY
     An echo utility appeared in Version 2 AT&T UNIX.
