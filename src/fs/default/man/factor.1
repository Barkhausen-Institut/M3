FACTOR(6)                                BSD Games Manual                               FACTOR(6)

NAME
     factor, primes -- factor a number, generate primes

SYNOPSIS
     factor [number ...]
     primes [start [stop]]

DESCRIPTION
     The factor utility will factor 64-bit positive integers.  When a number is factored, it is
     printed, followed by a `:', and the list of its prime factors in ascending order, on a sin-
     gle line.  Every prime factor is printed as often as it divides the number.

     When factor is invoked with one or more arguments, each argument will be factored.

     When factor is invoked with no arguments, factor reads numbers, one per line, from standard
     input, until end of file or error.  White-space and empty lines are ignored.  Numbers may be
     preceded by a single +.  After a number is read, it is factored.  Input lines must not be
     longer than 99 characters.

     The primes utility prints primes in ascending order, one per line, starting at or above
     start and continuing until, but not including stop.  The start value must be at least 0 and
     not greater than stop.  The stop value must not be greater than 4294967295.  The default
     value of stop is 4294967295.

     When the primes utility is invoked with no arguments, start is read from standard input.
     stop is taken to be 4294967295.  The start value may be preceded by a single +.  The input
     line must not be longer than 99 characters.

BUGS
     factor cannot handle the "10 most wanted" factor list; primes won't get you a world record.
