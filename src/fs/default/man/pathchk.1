PATHCHK(1)                         BSD General Commands Manual                         PATHCHK(1)

NAME
     pathchk -- check pathnames

SYNOPSIS
     pathchk [-pP] pathname ...

DESCRIPTION
     The pathchk utility checks whether each of the specified pathname arguments is valid or por-
     table.

     A diagnostic message is written for each argument that:

     o   Is longer than PATH_MAX bytes.

     o   Contains any component longer than NAME_MAX bytes.  (The value of NAME_MAX depends on
         the underlying file system.)

     o   Contains a directory component that is not searchable.

     It is not considered an error if a pathname argument contains a nonexistent component as
     long as a component by that name could be created.

     The options are as follows:

     -p      Perform portability checks on the specified pathname arguments.  Diagnostic messages
             will be written for each argument that:

             o   Is longer than _POSIX_PATH_MAX (255) bytes.

             o   Contains a component longer than _POSIX_NAME_MAX (14) bytes.

             o   Contains any character not in the portable filename character set (that is, al-
                 phanumeric characters, `.', `-' and `_').  No component may start with the hy-
                 phen (`-') character.

     -P      In addition to the default or -p checks, write a diagnostic for each argument that:

             o   Is empty.

             o   Contains a component that starts with a hyphen.

EXIT STATUS
     The pathchk utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

EXAMPLES
     Check whether the names of files in the current directory are portable to other POSIX sys-
     tems:

           find . -exec pathchk -p -- {} +
