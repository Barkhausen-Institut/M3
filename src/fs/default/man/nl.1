NAME
     nl -- line numbering filter

SYNOPSIS
     nl [-p] [-b type] [-d delim] [-f type] [-h type] [-i incr] [-l num] [-n format] [-s sep]
        [-v startnum] [-w width] [file]

DESCRIPTION
     The nl utility reads lines from the named file, applies a configurable line numbering filter
     operation, and writes the result to the standard output.  If file is a single dash (`-') or
     absent, nl reads from the standard input.

     The nl utility treats the text it reads in terms of logical pages.  Unless specified other-
     wise, line numbering is reset at the start of each logical page.  A logical page consists of
     a header, a body and a footer section; empty sections are valid.  Different line numbering
     options are independently available for header, body and footer sections.

     The starts of logical page sections are signaled by input lines containing nothing but one
     of the following sequences of delimiter characters:

           Line       Start of
           \:\:\:     header
           \:\:       body
           \:         footer

     If the input does not contain any logical page section signaling directives, the text being
     read is assumed to consist of a single logical page body.

     The following options are available:

     -b type
             Specify the logical page body lines to be numbered.  Recognized type arguments are:

             a          Number all lines.

             t          Number only non-empty lines.

             n          No line numbering.

             pexpr      Number only those lines that contain the basic regular expression speci-
                        fied by expr.

             The default type for logical page body lines is t.

     -d delim
             Specify the delimiter characters used to indicate the start of a logical page sec-
             tion in the input file.  At most two characters may be specified; if only one char-
             acter is specified, the first character is replaced and the second character remains
             unchanged.  The default delim characters are `\:'.

     -f type
             Specify the same as -b type except for logical page footer lines.  The default type
             for logical page footer lines is n.

     -h type
             Specify the same as -b type except for logical page header lines.  The default type
             for logical page header lines is n.

     -i incr
             Specify the increment value used to number logical page lines.  The default incr
             value is 1.

     -l num  If numbering of all lines is specified for the current logical section using the
             corresponding -b a, -f a or -h a option, specify the number of adjacent blank lines
             to be considered as one.  For example, -l 2 results in only the second adjacent
             blank line being numbered.  The default num value is 1.

     -n format
             Specify the line numbering output format.  Recognized format arguments are:

                   ln    Left justified.
                   rn    Right justified, leading zeros suppressed.
                   rz    Right justified, leading zeros kept.

             The default format is rn.

     -p      Specify that line numbering should not be restarted at logical page delimiters.

     -s sep  Specify the characters used in separating the line number and the corresponding text
             line.  The default sep setting is a single tab character.

     -v startnum
             Specify the initial value used to number logical page lines; see also the descrip-
             tion of the -p option.  The default startnum value is 1.

     -w width
             Specify the number of characters to be occupied by the line number; if the width is
             insufficient to hold the line number, it will be truncated to its width least sig-
             nificant digits.  The default width is 6.

ENVIRONMENT
     LC_CTYPE  The character encoding locale(1).  It decides which byte sequences form characters
               for the -d option.  If unset or set to "C", "POSIX", or an unsupported value, each
               byte is treated as a character.

EXIT STATUS
     The nl utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
