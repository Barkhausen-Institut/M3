HEAD(1)                            BSD General Commands Manual                            HEAD(1)

NAME
     head -- display first few lines of files

SYNOPSIS
     head [-count | -n count] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
     The head utility copies the first count lines of each specified file to the standard output.
     If no files are named, head copies lines from the standard input.  If count is omitted, it
     defaults to 10.

     The options are as follows:

     -count | -n count
             Copy the first count lines of each input file to the standard output.  count must be
             a positive decimal integer.

     If more than one file is specified, head precedes the output of each file with the follow-
     ing, in order to distinguish files:

           ==> file <==

EXIT STATUS
     The head utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

EXAMPLES
     To display the first 500 lines of the file foo:

           $ head -n 500 foo

     head can be used in conjunction with tail(1) in the following way to, for example, display
     only line 500 from the file foo:

           $ head -n 500 foo | tail -1

SEE ALSO
     cat(1), cut(1), less(1), more(1), tail(1)

STANDARDS
     The head utility is compliant with the IEEE Std 1003.1-2008 ("POSIX.1") specification.

     The historic syntax -count is supported by this implementation.

HISTORY
     The head utility first appeared in 1BSD.
