MV(1)                              BSD General Commands Manual                              MV(1)

NAME
     mv -- move files

SYNOPSIS
     mv [-fiv] source target
     mv [-fiv] source ... directory

DESCRIPTION
     In its first form, the mv utility moves the file named by the source operand to the destina-
     tion path named by the target operand.  This form is assumed when the last operand does not
     name an already existing directory.

     In its second form, mv moves each file named by a source operand to the destination speci-
     fied by the directory operand.  It is an error if the directory does not exist.  The desti-
     nation path for each source operand is the pathname produced by the concatenation of the
     directory operand, a slash, and the final pathname component of the named file.

     In both forms, a source operand is skipped with an error message when the respective desti-
     nation path is a non-empty directory, or when the source is a non-directory file but the
     destination path is a directory, or vice versa.

     The options are as follows:

     -f      Do not prompt for confirmation before overwriting the destination path.  The -f op-
             tion overrides any previous -i options.

     -i      Causes mv to write a prompt to standard error before moving a file that would over-
             write an existing file.  If the response from the standard input begins with the
             character "y", the move is attempted.  The -i option overrides any previous -f op-
             tions.

     -v      Display the source and destination after each move.

     The mv utility moves symbolic links, not the files referenced by the links.

     If the destination path does not have a mode which permits writing, mv prompts the user for
     confirmation as specified for the -i option.

     Should the rename(2) call fail because the source and destination are on different file sys-
     tems, mv will imitate cp(1) and rm(1) to accomplish the move.  The effect is equivalent to:

           $ rm -df -- destination_path && \
               cp -PRp -- source destination_path && \
               rm -rf -- source

EXIT STATUS
     The mv utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

EXAMPLES
     Rename file foo to bar, overwriting bar if it already exists:

           $ mv -f foo bar

     Either of these commands will rename the file -f to bar, prompting for confirmation if bar
     already exists:

           $ mv -i -- -f bar
           $ mv -i ./-f bar

SEE ALSO
     cp(1), rm(1), rename(2), symlink(7)

STANDARDS
     The mv utility is compliant with the IEEE Std 1003.1-2008 ("POSIX.1") specification.

     The flag [-v] is an extension to that specification.

HISTORY
     A mv command appeared in Version 1 AT&T UNIX.

CAVEATS
     In the second synopsis form, incompatible file types in source and directory cause partial
     moves.  For example, if f and g are non-directory files and d and d/f are directories, the
     command

           $ mv f g d

     will print an error message, leave f where it is, move g to d/g and return a non-zero exit
     status.
