SYNC(8)                            BSD System Manager's Manual                            SYNC(8)

NAME
     sync -- force completion of pending disk writes (flush cache)

SYNOPSIS
     sync

DESCRIPTION
     The sync utility can be called to ensure that all disk writes have been completed before the
     processor is halted in a way not suitably done by reboot(8) or halt(8).  Generally, it is
     preferable to use reboot(8) or halt(8) to shut down the system, as they may perform addi-
     tional actions such as resynchronizing the hardware clock and flushing internal caches be-
     fore performing a final sync.

     sync utilizes the sync(2) function.

SEE ALSO
