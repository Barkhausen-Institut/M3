PASTE(1)                           BSD General Commands Manual                           PASTE(1)

NAME
     paste -- merge corresponding or subsequent lines of files

SYNOPSIS
     paste [-s] [-d list] file ...

DESCRIPTION
     The paste utility concatenates the corresponding lines of the given input files, replacing
     all but the last file's newline characters with a single tab character, and writes the re-
     sulting lines to standard output.  If end-of-file is reached on an input file while other
     input files still contain data, the file is treated as if it were an endless source of empty
     lines.

     The options are as follows:

     -d list
             Use one or more of the provided characters to replace the newline characters instead
             of the default tab.  The characters in list are used circularly, i.e., when list is
             exhausted the first character from list is reused.  This continues until a line from
             the last input file (in default operation) or the last line in each file (using the
             -s option) is displayed, at which time paste begins selecting characters from the
             beginning of list again.

             The following special characters can also be used in list:

             \n    newline character
             \t    tab character
             \\    backslash character
             \0    empty string (not a null character)

             Any other character preceded by a backslash is equivalent to the character itself.

     -s      Concatenate all of the lines of each separate input file in command line order.  The
             newline character of every line except the last line in each input file is replaced
             with the tab character, unless otherwise specified by the -d option.

     If "-" is specified for one or more of the input files, the standard input is used; standard
     input is read one line at a time, circularly, for each instance of "-".

EXIT STATUS
     The paste utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

EXAMPLES
     List the files in the current directory in three columns:

           $ ls | paste - - -
           $ ls | paste -s -d '\t\t\n' -

     Combine pairs of lines from file into single lines:

           $ paste - - < file
           $ paste -s -d '\t\n' file

     Number the lines in file, similar to `cat -n':

           $ sed = file | paste - -
           $ sed = file | paste -s -d '\t\n' -

     Create a colon-separated list of directories named bin, suitable for use in the PATH envi-
     ronment variable:

           $ find / -name bin -type d | paste -s -d : -

STANDARDS
     The paste utility is compliant with the IEEE Std 1003.1-2008 ("POSIX.1") specification.
