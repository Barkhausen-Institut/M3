PWD(1)                             BSD General Commands Manual                             PWD(1)

NAME
     pwd -- return working directory name

SYNOPSIS
     pwd [-LP]

DESCRIPTION
     The pwd utility prints the absolute pathname of the current working directory to the stan-
     dard output.

     The options are as follows:

     -L      If the PWD environment variable is an absolute pathname that references the current
             directory and doesn't contain path components of "." or "..", then PWD is printed as
             the name of the current directory.  Otherwise, act as if the -P option was given.

     -P      Print the physical path to the current working directory, with symbolic links in the
             path resolved.

     The -L and -P options override each other and the command's actions are determined by the
     last one specified.  The default if no options are given is -P.

     For an explanation of the directory hierarchy, see hier(7).

ENVIRONMENT
     PWD  The presumptive logical path to the current working directory.

EXIT STATUS
     The pwd utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

STANDARDS
     The pwd utility is compliant with the IEEE Std 1003.1-2008 ("POSIX.1") specification, except
     the standard says the default if no options are given should be to behave as if -L had been
     specified.

HISTORY
     An pwd utility appeared in Version 5 AT&T UNIX.  Support for the -L option was added in
     OpenBSD 5.6.

CAVEATS
     pwd also exists as a built-in to ksh(1), which may have a different default behavior.
