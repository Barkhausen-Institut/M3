DATE(1)                            BSD General Commands Manual                            DATE(1)

NAME
     date -- display or set date and time

SYNOPSIS
     date [-aju] [-f pformat] [-r seconds] [-z output_zone] [+format]
          [[[[[[cc]yy]mm]dd]HH]MM[.SS]]

DESCRIPTION
     When invoked without arguments, the date utility displays the current date and time.  Other-
     wise, depending on the options specified, date will set the date and time or print it in a
     user-defined way.

     Changing the system date has some risks, as described in settimeofday(2).  Only the supe-
     ruser may change the date.

     The options are as follows:

     -a      Use the adjtime(2) call to gradually skew the local time to the desired time rather
             than just hopping.

     -f pformat
             Parse the specified time using strptime(3) with a format string of pformat.

     -j      Parse the provided date and time and display the result without changing the clock.

     -r seconds
             Print out (in specified format) the date and time represented by seconds from the
             Epoch.

     -u      Display or set the date in UTC (Coordinated Universal) time.

     -z output_zone
             Just before printing the time, change to the specified timezone; see the description
             of TZ below.  This can be used with -j to easily convert time specifications from
             one zone to another.

     An operand with a leading plus sign (`+') signals a user-defined format string which speci-
     fies the format in which to display the date and time.  The format string may contain any of
     the conversion specifications described in the strftime(3) manual page, as well as any arbi-
     trary text.  A newline (`\n') character is always output after the characters specified by
     the format string.  The format string for the default display is:

           %a %b %e %H:%M:%S %Z %Y

     If an operand does not have a leading plus sign, it is interpreted as a value for setting
     the system's notion of the current date and time.  The canonical representation for setting
     the date and time is:

           ccyy    Year.  If yy is specified, but cc is not, a value for yy between 69 and 99 re-
                   sults in a cc value of 19.  Otherwise, a cc value of 20 is used.
           mm      Month: a number from 1 to 12.
           dd      Day: a number from 1 to 31.
           HH      Hour: a number from 0 to 23.
           MM      Minute: a number from 0 to 59.
           SS      Second: a number from 0 to 60 (permitting a leap second), preceded by a pe-
                   riod.

     Everything but the minute is optional.

     Time changes for Daylight Saving Time, standard time, leap seconds, and leap years are han-
     dled automatically.

ENVIRONMENT
     TZ      The time zone to use when parsing or displaying dates.  It is normally specified as
             a pathname relative to /usr/share/zoneinfo, though see tzset(3) for more informa-
             tion.  If this variable is not set, the time zone is determined based on
             /etc/localtime, which the administrator adjusts using the -l option of zic(8).

FILES
     /var/log/wtmp      record of date resets and time changes
     /var/log/messages  record of the user setting the time

EXIT STATUS
     The date utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

EXAMPLES
     Display the date using the specified format string:

           $ date "+DATE: %Y-%m-%d%nTIME: %H:%M:%S"
           DATE: 1987-11-21
           TIME: 13:36:16

     Set the date to June 13, 1985, 4:27 PM:

           # date 198506131627

     Set the time to 2:32 PM, without modifying the date:

           # date 1432

     If the mailing list server located in California is being taken offline at 05.45, work out
     what time it will be locally, here in Tokyo:

           $ TZ=America/Los_Angeles date -j -z Asia/Tokyo 0545

STANDARDS
     The date utility is compliant with the IEEE Std 1003.1-2008 ("POSIX.1") specification.

     The flags [-afjrz], as well as the conversion specifiers `%F', `%G', `%g', `%k', `%l', `%R',
     `%s', `%v', and `%+', are extensions to that specification.

     This implementation requires the traditional BSD date format, [[[[[cc]yy]mm]dd]HH]MM[.SS],
     which differs from the X/Open System Interfaces option of the IEEE Std 1003.1-2008
     ("POSIX.1") specification.
