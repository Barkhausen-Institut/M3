SYNOPSIS
     tee [-ai] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
     The tee utility copies standard input to standard output, making a copy in zero or more
     files.  The output is unbuffered.

     The options are as follows:

     -a      Append the output to the files rather than overwriting them.

     -i      Ignore the SIGINT signal.

     The following operands are available:

     file  A pathname of an output file.

     The tee utility takes the default action for all signals, except in the event of the -i op-
     tion.

EXIT STATUS
     The tee utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

STANDARDS
     The tee utility is compliant with the IEEE Std 1003.1-2008 ("POSIX.1") specification.
